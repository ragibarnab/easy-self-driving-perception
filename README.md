# Easy Self-Driving Perception

## Motivation
This project is my modular approach to self-driving perception in ROS 2. The motto is: "simple, yet effective". The goal is to integrate effective perception components over time as I learn them, while making them as simple as possible to work with. Mostly written in Python for its simplicity and readability, allowing me to develop the components without wasting too much time programming.
